Using the functions located in the aruba_auth.py module, connect to the Aruba controllers.

Configure the VLAN name for VLAN 909 to be "guest3". You should use the "object/vlan_name_id" to accomplish this.
Look up the required payload in the Aruba API documentation at https://aruba.lasthop.io:4343/api/.

"object/vlan_name_id" is in the "Interfaces" section of the documentation.

After you have configured the VLAN, execute write memory.

Finally, gracefully logout using the logout function.
